A lazy rain am I
The skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like the noon
A sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
Hear me now
Platypus are a few
The secret life of roo
A personality I never knew
Get it on
My Greta weighs a ton
The archer's on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time, and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip
A sailing on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time, and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waiting, I've been waiting
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waiting, I've been waiting
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waiting, I've been waiting
Waitin' on another black summer to end
